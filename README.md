#Interactive JavaScript Quiz

Introduction
This is my Interactive JavaScript Quiz project. This app was designed for Assignment 3 of CPAN 134, it is a simple interactive quiz built with html,css and javascript that provides you instant feedback and highlights incorrect and correct answers.

#Features
Structure and Design
The quiz is structured using semantic HTML, styled with CSS to make it visually appealing, and enhanced with JavaScript for interactivity. Each question comes with multiple choice answers, and the quiz gives you immediate feedback when you submit your answers.

#Authentication
I implemented a simple fake authentication using a JavaScript variable. This means you won't see the quiz unless the authentication variable is set to true. Itâ€™s a basic simulation but adds an interesting layer to the project.


#How It Works
Building the Quiz: The buildQuiz() function dynamically generates the quiz questions and answers.
Showing Results: The showResults() function checks your answers, highlights the correct ones, and displays your score.
